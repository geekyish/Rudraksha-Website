<p>
    The same has been followed since ages during GURUKUL ERA, till now a days with the importance and requirement has been increased manifolds this date. The importance of Skill Development can easily be measured as comparisons are being done with warriors like ARJUNA, KARAN, and EKLAVYA. In our country still today our Trainers, Teachers, Coaches have a dream of achieving any student who falls under anyone of the above category. Now a day’s Government is also quite serious about Skill Development of Youths in order to provide them with best learning opportunities and conducive environment to nurture their skills and make their careers. UNESCO also have a Skill Development Mission and in line to the same celebrate a World Skill Development Day on July 15 every year. The National Skills Development Corporation (NSDC) facilitates initiatives that can potentially have a multiplier effect as opposed to being an actual operator in this space. In doing so, it strives to involve the industry in all aspects of skill development. There are several programs run under flagship of NSDC, and an overview about the same is listed below from the respected Government web portals. Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) is the flagship scheme of the Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDE) implemented by National Skill Development Corporation. The objective of this Skill Certification Scheme is to enable a large number of Indian youth to take up industry-relevant skill training that will help them in securing a better livelihood. Individuals with prior learning experience or skills will also be assessed and certified under Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL). Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Kendra is a scheme under which Vocational training needs to be made aspirational to transform India into the skill capital of the world. In line with the same, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship ( MSDE ) intends to establish visible and aspirational Model Training Centres ( MTCs ) in every district of the country. NSDC is the implementation agency for the project. Udaan, the Special Industry Initiative (SII) for J&K is funded by Ministry of Home Affairs and implemented by National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC). The programme is a part of the overall initiative for addressing economic issues in J&K. While steps are being taken by the State and Central Government to revive economic activity in J&K, Udaan programme is a special initiative to address the needs of the educated unemployed in J&K.

    The different Skill Development Program that will be conducted by Recognized and Approved Centers under this head are as follows: A structured training and development program ensures that employees have a consistent experience and background knowledge. The consistency is particularly relevant for the company's basic policies and procedures. The training may also build the employee's confidence because she has a stronger understanding of the industry and the responsibilities of her job. This confidence may push her to perform even better and think of new ideas that help her excel. The investment in training that a company makes shows the employees they are valued. The training creates a supportive workplace. A development program brings all employees to a higher level so they all have similar skills and knowledge. This helps reduce any weak links within the company who rely heavily on others to complete basic work tasks. The short listing of the Institutes, Universities and Colleges for conducting such programs will be done which have either being a part of Government Bodies or have a quality module with most effective costing in a Private sector. The candidates will be provided all the details along with their Parents (in case of minor) and a written consent before their enrollment in the concerned program. The Foundation will be offering such approved courses through Authorized Institutes to the weaker section of the society who either approaches us or we came to know about their need to attain knowledge of such Advocacy Programs. We will also participate aggressively in the general public awareness programs which are related to Health, Life Safety, Human Rights, Consumer Rights, Voting Rights, Various Government Schemes & Programs Awareness etc. The prime objective is to assist the needy in getting his rights within due course of time and without any corruption.
