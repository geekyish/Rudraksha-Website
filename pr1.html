    We at RUDRAKSHA, are working on the Project Name “YATHA VAYUPATTI” under the Project Head 
    “ART, LITERATURE, RELIGION and CULTURE”, working rigorously to nurture and care the Art 
    and Culture of forgotten era, old literatures, cultural and beliefs of various creeds 
    of our Hindu civilization. Every morning, many people enjoy sitting outside watching sunrise. 
    They feel relaxed seeing the arrival of the sun with its pure light and the traveling of the 
    night with its darkness. They consider that a new life will start as the sun starts her 
    new life. Not only they watch the sun, many people enjoy drawing this view because they 
    will feel for once that their minds are relaxed and not thinking except in this new born. 
    People do like the view of rainfall, rainbow, snowfall, stars, mountains, rivers, oceans and 
    natural vegetation. All of this is natural art and have a mesmerising view. “Art is your 
    emotions flowing in a river of imagination".If you stand for a moment in front. any work of 
    art, which has many shapes and many lines cannot be described, you start to imagine things 
    by walking on that lines and shapes trying to connect them to get a specific shape done from 
    your imagination.Art is everywhere in the entire world. It is one's creativity and imagination.
</p>
<p>
  Art is the most things you use and see always without paying attention to that. Art help us see everything and everyone completely different. Art is not a reading to get bored or listening to get epileptic, it’s something which opens to us a field of questions and answers to things we see. Art can be in different forms audio like music, songs, and poems. Visual as film making, photography and painting, they differ depending on artist, style and material used. They can be in the form of music, song or poetries. They help in relaxing one’s mind. Music is thought to link all of the emotional and physical elements of the universe. Music can also be used to change person’s mood, and has been found to cause like physical responses in many people simultaneously. Music also has the ability to strengthen or weaken emotions from a particular event such as a funeral. Visual arts are popular art. Artists place images, forms, colours, ideas, down in such a way that can be communicated with you the viewer. When you read the work, it will serve your understanding in a multitude of vibrant ways. It will begin to make sense, in some cases a perverse kind of sense. Art is an expression of a particular person, or group of people. Art can have a large effect on culture, as it can be symbolic of traits, morals, and religious characteristics. An artist is defined as a person whose creative work shows sensitivity and imagination. That sensitivity and imagination is what can make a culture. Artists have the ability to manipulate the form of their art therefore manipulating the experience of that art. Art is everywhere; it is in the car we drive, the magazine we read, and in the food that we eat.Art is something that influences many parts of our lives. Literature is the foundation of life.It places an emphasis on many topics from human tragedies to tales of the ever-popular search for love. While it is physically written in words, these words come alive in the imagination of the mind, and its ability to comprehend the complexity or simplicity of the text. Literature enables people to see through the lenses of others, and sometimes even inanimate objects; therefore, it becomes a looking glass into the world as others view it. It is a journey that is inscribed in pages, and powered by the imagination of the reader. Ultimately, literature has provided a gateway to teach the reader about life experiences from even the saddest stories to the most joyful ones that will touch their hearts.

    There are four types of Vedas - Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. One of the best sources of Ancient Indian History is Vedic literature and they also form the basis of classical Hinduism. The oldest Veda is the Rigveda. It has 1028 hymns called ‘Suktas’ and is a collection of 10 books called ‘Mandalas.’ The meaning of Rigveda is “Praise Knowledge”. Samaveda is known as the Veda of melodies and chants, it dates back to 1200-800 BCE. This Veda is related to public worship. It is considered as the root of the Indian classic music and dance. Yajurveda mean ‘Worship Knowledge’, Yajurveda dates back to 1100-800 BCE; corresponding with Samaveda. It compiles ritual-offering mantras/chants. These chants were offered by the priest alongside a person who used to perform a ritual (in most cases yajna fire). Atharvaveda means a tatpurusha compound of Atharvan, an ancient sage, and knowledge (atharvan+knowledge), it dates back to 1000-800 BCE. There is a strong belief among the Hindus that the revered compositions of the vedas passed on through generations by the word of mouth from time immemorial and hence the general assumption is that the Vedic hymns were either taught by the God to the sages or that they were revealed themselves to "mantradrasta". There are many Indian literatures like Guru Granth Sahib is the central religious scripture of Sikhism, regarded by Sikhs as the final, sovereign and eternal living Guru following the lineage of the ten human gurus of the religion. Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru, added all 115 hymns of Guru Tegh Bahadur, the ninth Sikh Guru, to the Adi Granth and affirmed the text as his successor. The vision in the Guru Granth Sahib is of a society based on divine justice without oppression of any kind. Numerology is any study of the purported divine, mystical or other special relationship between a number and some coinciding observed events. Today, numerology is often associated with the paranormal, alongside astrology and similar divinatory arts. The term numerologist is also used derogatorily for those perceived to place excess faith in numerical patterns, even if those people do not practice traditional numerology. Astrology is the study of positions and aspects of celestial bodies in the belief that they have an influence on the course of natural earthly occurrences and human affairs. Astrology has a long line of history and a bright future. Vastusashtra is a science which tells about the place which is favourable for man to inhabit and regarding the “design of the house which can bring happiness in its owner’s life. The study of Vastusashtra is very ancient. Its origin dates back to the Vedic age. Vastusashtra has been classified into many divisions like Grihavastu, Prasadvastu, Nagarvastu, Durgvastu etc. Apart from Guru Granth, Vedas, Vaastu Shastra Astrology and Numerology there are many other literatures like, Red Book, Astro Science, Sanskrit Script, Tarot reading, etc. The Hebrew culture was solely centered upon religion. The one main literature item modern scholars have to study from this nation was the Torah. The Torah also known as the Pentateuch is the main source of the Hebrew government and everyday living situations. The aspect of religion and culture is what shapes the lives of all humans, whither they are believers or not. Whole nations have dress codes to keep to their religious values. India has a rich culture and that has become our identity. Be it in religion, art, intellectual achievements, or performing arts, it has made us a colorful, rich, and diverse nation. The Indian culture and tradition essay is a guideline to the vibrant cultures and traditions followed in India. Although people are turning modern today, hold on to the moral values and celebrates the festivals according to customs.So, we are still living and learning epic lessons from Ramayana and Mahabharata. The culture in India is everything from people’s living, rituals, values, beliefs, habits, care, knowledge, etc.Also, India is considered as the oldest civilization where people still follows their old habits of care and humanity.Additionally, culture is a way through which we behave with others,how softly we react to different things, our understanding of ethics, values, and beliefs.

    People from the old generation pass their beliefs and cultures to the upcoming generation. Thus, every child that behaves well with others has already learned about their culture from grandparents and parents. Also, in India we can see culture in everything like fashion, music, dance, social norms, foods, etc. Thus, India is one big melting pot for having behaviours and beliefs which gave birth to different cultures. There are many religions that have found their origin in age-old methods that are five thousand years old. Also, it is considered because Hinduism was originated from Vedas. Thus, all the Hindu scriptures that are considered holy have been scripted in the Sanskrit language. Also, it is believed that Jainism has ancient origin and existence in the Indus valley. Buddhism is the other religion that was originated in the country through the teachings of Gautam Buddha. There are many different eras that have come and gone but no era was very powerful to change the influence of the real culture. So, the culture of younger generations is still connected to the older generations. Also, our ethnic culture always teaches us to respect elders, behave well, care for helpless people, and help needy and poor people. Additionally, there is a great culture in our country that we should always welcome guest like gods. That is why we have a famous saying like ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’. So, the basic roots in our culture are spiritual practices and humanity. India is a land of rich culture and tradition which teaches people blindness, generosity and tolerance. It differs from place to place as it is a multilingual, multicultural and multi-ethnic society. Indian culture is a unique blend of modern western culture and historic traditions. We are living in a country of great legends where many great people were born and remembered forever due to their sacrifice for the nation. People across the world come to enjoy and feel the culture and tradition of our country.
