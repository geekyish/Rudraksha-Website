    We at RUDRAKSHA will try to do every possible thing we can for the people who are alone i.e. the ones who are the only one member in their family, unable to fulfil their needs, lives on the road corners, not having any money to lead a better life and have a sudden demises or due to any illness or unnoticed demise or any untoward incident. Also, many families do not even have adequate financial position to live properly, and cannot afford the basic needs, and have a sudden death in their family. These families cannot afford even the prelamination of their beloved family member and due to this reason, these dead bodies get rotten. We will try to help these families, unclaimed bodies, and the ones who are alone, with a religious prelamination, with all the cultures and rituals and help them in gathering all the things which are needed. All the customs will be done in due diligence of priests, authorities from administration department, police, and family or relatives if any. We hope LORD MAHAKAAL will have mercy and make their souls rest in peace and allows us to perform the last duties of such unfortunate ones.
